        <h1>on HTML Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This page goes over all things HTML when building a website, from my own perspective. 
            Not so much a teaching page as a personal reminder on how to do this, IMOW, as a quick 
            reference.
        </p>
        <h2>Before you Start</h2>
        <p>
            Create a folder for your web projects. In the web project, you will have different
            folders for sites on there. In each site folder, you should have: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>a folder for images</li>
                <li>a folder for scripts (JS files go here)</li>
                <li>a folder for styles (CSS files go here)</li>
                <li>an HTML file to access the webpage</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            You can create HTML, CSS, and JS files through Visual Code Studio. In our first 
            tests, we used "index.html", "style.css" in styles folder, and "main.js" in 
            scripts folder.</p>
        <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
        <p>Every basic HTML file has this structure:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>!DOCTYPE html</li>
                <li>html (set lang here, for better indexing) lang="en-US"</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Inside the HTML element:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>head</li>
                <li>body</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Inside the head element:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>chosen character set</li>
                <li>title (for browser tab)</li>
                <li>link to CSS sheet (link rel="stylesheet" href="cssfile.css")</li>
                <li>link to JS file (script src="jsfile.js" defer)</li>
                <li>link to font set</li>
                <li>keywords, page desc, etc</li>
                <li>favicon (icons but for HTML)</li>
                <li>other metadata</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Inside the body element:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>all content seen by web user (that's you!)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Head Element</h2>
        <p>
            On the head: The h1 element should be used only once, to mark up the title of your page
            content, like the story title or news headliner, etc. Lots of meta elements, so only
            going over a few for now.
        </p>
        <p>Meta name content elements can be used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the author of the page (to contact author)</li>
                <li>the description of the page (keywords for SEO, search engine desc)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>To create a favicon:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>save img in same directory as site's index page in .ico format
                    (NOTE: you can use other img types, but won't be supported in older browsers)
                </li>
                <li>create link in head: link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Note that they're also used as high res icons for iPad homescreen apps. Fairly advanced
            feature, so don't worry about implementing these for now, just be able to recognize them.</p>
        <h2>Misc HTML</h2>
        <p>Span elements used when you want to apply CSS or JS to content (more later)</p>
        <p>Can create lists within lists.</p>
        <p>
            To emphasize, use em element. To bold, use strong element. Traditionally, i was used for 
            italics in foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought, etc... 
            Traditionally, b was used for bold in key words, product names, lead sentences, etc... 
            Traditionally, u was used for underline in proper name, misspelling, hyperlinks, etc... 
            Try not to use these last three elements outside of these traditional uses.
        </p>
        <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>
            A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string of text that defines where something is 
            located on the Web. URLs use paths to find files. Usually in href="file" if in same
            directory or href="directory/file" if in subdirectories or href="../directory/file" if
            in parent directories. To go up one directory, use .. dots.
        </p>
        <p>
            A URL hyperlink can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and
            audio files, or anything else that lives on the web. To create a link, use a
            href="https://www.google.com/" text. Click on the text, and it takes you where you
            want to go. You can also add title after the href to display text when the mouse hovers
            over the link. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can link to specific parts of an HTML document (aka document fragment) by:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>assigning an id attribute to element you want to link to (h2 id="abc")</li>
            <li>include id at end of URL preceded by hash symbol (a href="ex.html#abc")</li>
            <li>(can link to another part of current doc by using on its own in href="#abc")</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The difference between absolute URL and relative URL: absolute links to 
            <strong>absolute</strong>
            location in web (always points to same location, no matter where its used) and 
            relative links to 
            <strong>relative</strong>
            location in web (points in different places depending 
            on actual location of file you refer from). Absolute includes protocol and domain name,
            relative usually just file name or directory and file name.
        </p>
        <p>Best practices when writing links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use clear link wording (download FireFox instead of click here)</li>
            <li>don't repeat URL as part of link text (ugly)</li>
            <li>don't say "links" or "links to" in line text (repetitive)</li>
            <li>keep line text as short as possible</li>
            <li>when linking non-HTML resources, leave clear signposts (download report,
                watch video, play game)</li>
            <li>when linking to downloadable, include download attribute to provide default
                save filename</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Email Links</h2>
        <p>
            When writing email links, use href="mailto:email@email.org". To write Share links,
            don't include the email -- it'll send you tio the email client with no destination
            address.
        </p>
